### Hi there üê±‚Äçüë§

I'm a friendly software engineer and architect currently jumping into some open-source projects. I see gaps that need to be filled and work on getting solutions out there to be used.

### Projects
#### [Powershell as a Service](https://github.com/WarGravy/PowerShell-As-A-Service)
One of the things I really like about Linux is how easy it is to write bash services. In Windows, we have PowerShell which is quite awesome and powerful, but no easy way to run those powershell scripts as services. I wrote this dotnet core windows service to do just that.


### Upcoming Projects
#### Soap support for dotnet core APIs
Ever dealt with a legacy application that has a SOAP client and you just want to replace the backing SOAP service with a RESTFul api but don't really care to recompile and take on that technical debt? I'm working on getting an open-source nuget package that will help make your dotnet api bilingual. Bilingual in the sense where you can respond to both RESTful api requests and old SOAP requests.
